# Transliterate App
This is a Shiny web application that converts text from cyrillic transcription system to some others. It is unfinished work and primarily intended for testing different models and their consistencies.

The transliteration models are especially tailored for Southern Udmurt dialects and their phonological pecularities, we are not yet certain whether they work as such with other dialects and how small differences could be best implemented.
